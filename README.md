I was faced with such a problem that I had to find out the country code by the name of the country. I googled it, but I didn't find anything. I decided to write a parser that will make a dictionary (country - code) and Vice versa (code - country). Below you can see 3 files: parser, dictionary (country-code), dictionary (code-country).
P.S.
Sorry, my English is not my native language.
